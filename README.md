Disaster Damage Assessment of Satellite Images Using Transfer Learning With Fine Tuning

 Integration of Emerging technologies offers tremendous potential to buildÂ a Rapid Disaster assessment that can accelerate decisions and relief operations. Identifying visible structural damages by various natural calamities and explosions is an essential activity in Rapid Disaster Assessment. Convolution Neural Networks have been shown to outperform traditional methods in a number of recent studies. However, the number of publicly available image datasets for structural disaster damages are limited.
The performance of existing CNN architectures for damage detection in terms of transfer learning with fine-tuning is investigated in this work. Further, a new set of fully-connected layers are placed in VGG16 architecture based on damage-based features extracted from the Dataset. VGG16 is a base of the model which converts each 128x128x3 image to a 4x4x512 block of features. Then features like saturation, contrast, brightness, and sharpness of the images slightly changed to finalize the prediction scores. This model predicts a score on every input image after dividing it into smaller parts, and classification is applied to each of them. Results to input images are scores in the range -1 to 1, informing about the intensity of the damage incurred in the area.
